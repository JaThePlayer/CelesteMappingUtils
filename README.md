# MappingUtils

A mod using ImGuiHelper (requires .Net Core Everest!) which adds many utilities for mappers:
* Change bloom and darkness metadata in-game with a slider
* Change colorgrade with a dropdown
* List of all session flags, with the ability to add/remove them
* Change camera offset with a slider
* Spawn many holdables on top of the player
* No Clip+Fly
* Change colors of Frost Helper spinners with a color picker
* Edit stylegrounds in-game
* Profile the performance of rooms with a live-updating table

All changes done via Mapping Utils are temporary and are NOT saved to the map's .bin file.
Once you find values you like, you can copy them from the in-game UI into a map editor.

To open the Mapping Utils menu, press numpad3 (rebindable in mod options)
